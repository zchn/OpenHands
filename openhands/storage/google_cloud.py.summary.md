# Google Cloud Storage (google_cloud.py)

This module implements Google Cloud Storage integration for the OpenHands framework, providing cloud-based file storage capabilities.

## Key Features

### Cloud Operations
- Google Cloud Storage API integration
- Bucket management
- Object lifecycle
- Access control
- Metadata handling

### Storage Features
- File upload/download
- Stream operations
- Blob management
- Cache control
- Content types

### Configuration
- Authentication
- Project settings
- Regional options
- Storage classes
- Retention policies

## Implementation Details

### Core Operations
1. Upload Operations
   - Single file uploads
   - Multipart uploads
   - Resumable transfers
   - Progress tracking

2. Download Operations
   - File downloads
   - Streaming downloads
   - Partial downloads
   - Range requests

3. Management Operations
   - Object listing
   - Metadata updates
   - Access control
   - Object deletion

### Integration Points
- Works with FileStore interface
- Supports ConversationStore
- Backup functionality
- Resource management

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Operations
```python
store = GoogleCloudStorage(bucket_name="my-bucket")
store.upload_file("local/path", "cloud/path")
store.download_file("cloud/path", "local/path")
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# With metadata
store.upload_with_metadata("path", metadata={
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "cache-control": "public, max-age=3600"
})

# Stream operations
with store.stream_upload("path") as stream:
    stream.write(data)
```

## Error Handling
- Network errors
- Authentication failures
- Quota exceeded
- Invalid operations
- Timeout handling

## Security Features
- IAM integration
- Encryption at rest
- Access control lists
- Signed URLs
- Service accounts

## Performance Considerations
- Caching strategies
- Batch operations
- Parallel transfers
- Retry mechanisms
- Connection pooling

## Configuration Options
```python
config = {
    "project_id": "my-project",
    "bucket": "my-bucket",
    "location": "us-central1",
    "storage_class": "STANDARD"
}
```

## Best Practices
1. Error Handling
   - Implement retries
   - Handle timeouts
   - Log operations
   - Monitor quotas

2. Performance
   - Use appropriate storage classes
   - Implement caching
   - Optimize transfers
   - Batch operations

3. Security
   - Minimal permissions
   - Secure credentials
   - Monitor access
   - Regular audits

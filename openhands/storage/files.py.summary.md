# FileStore (files.py)

This module implements the core file system operations for the OpenHands framework, providing a robust and safe interface for file manipulation.

## Key Features

### File Operations
- Safe file reading and writing
- Atomic operations
- Directory management
- File locking mechanisms
- Path normalization

### Safety Mechanisms
- Thread-safe operations
- Error handling
- Path validation
- Permission checks
- Resource cleanup

### Storage Management
- File organization
- Temporary file handling
- Directory structure
- Path resolution
- Extension handling

## Implementation Details

### Core Operations
1. File Reading
   - Binary and text modes
   - Buffered operations
   - Encoding handling
   - Stream support

2. File Writing
   - Atomic writes
   - Backup creation
   - Temporary files
   - Lock management

3. Directory Operations
   - Creation/deletion
   - Recursive operations
   - Permission management
   - Path traversal

### Integration Points
- Used by ConversationStore
- Supports SettingsStore
- Provides backup functionality
- Handles resource files

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Operations
```python
store = FileStore()
store.write_file("path/to/file", content)
content = store.read_file("path/to/file")
```

### Directory Management
```python
store.ensure_directory("path/to/dir")
store.remove_directory("path/to/dir")
```

### Safe Operations
```python
with store.atomic_write("path/to/file") as f:
    f.write(content)
```

## Error Handling
- File not found
- Permission denied
- Lock timeouts
- Resource busy
- Path validation

## Security Considerations
- Path sanitization
- Permission checks
- Resource limits
- Lock management
- Cleanup procedures

# Events Directory

The `events` directory implements the event system that handles actions, observations, and their serialization in the OpenHands framework.

## Core Components

### Action Events (`action/`)
- `action.py`: Base action event definitions
- `agent.py`: Agent-specific actions
- `browse.py`: Web browsing actions
- `commands.py`: Command execution actions
- `files.py`: File operation actions
- `message.py`: Message handling actions
- `empty.py`: Empty action handling

### Observation Events (`observation/`)
- `observation.py`: Base observation types
- `agent.py`: Agent observations
- `browse.py`: Browser operation results
- `commands.py`: Command execution results
- `delegate.py`: Delegation results
- `error.py`: Error observations
- `files.py`: File operation results
- `reject.py`: Action rejection events
- `success.py`: Success event handling

### Serialization (`serialization/`)
- `action.py`: Action serialization
- `event.py`: Event serialization base
- `observation.py`: Observation serialization
- `utils.py`: Serialization utilities

### Event Management
- `stream.py`: Event streaming
- `tool.py`: Tool event handling
- `utils.py`: Event utilities
- `event.py`: Base event definitions

## Key Features
- Comprehensive event type system
- Bidirectional event flow (actions/observations)
- Serialization support for all events
- Stream-based event processing
- Error handling and recovery

## Implementation Details

### Event Types
- Actions: Commands from agents
- Observations: Results and feedback
- Tools: Tool-specific events
- System: Framework events

### Event Flow
1. Actions generated by agents
2. Actions processed by handlers
3. Observations generated from results
4. Observations routed to agents

### Serialization
- JSON-based serialization
- Type preservation
- Validation on serialization/deserialization
- Stream support

## Usage
The event system is used for:
1. Agent-system communication
2. Action processing and routing
3. Result observation handling
4. Tool integration
5. System state management

## Integration Points
- Used by controller for action handling
- Integrated with runtime for execution
- Connected to memory for event storage
- Used by agents for communication
